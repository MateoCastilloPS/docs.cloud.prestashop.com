# :bow_and_arrow: Submitting Your Module

Once the development of your module is done, it needs to be submitted for **technical and marketing validation** before it can be added to the [PrestaShop Marketplace](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/). Follow the procedure below to get your module validated.

## Create a Product Page

1. Log in to your [PrestaShop Marketplace account](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/login). Either you, your developer or your agency should have the credentials.

2. Access your seller account:

3. In the **Products** section, select **New** > **Add a Module**.

    :arrow_right: A new product sheet displays.

    - Available countries

        - Short description
        - Benefits for merchants (at least one)

5. Click on **Submit Your Product**.

:arrow_right: You can now proceed to the next step: submitting your zipped module.

## Submit Your Zipped Module

### Use the Validator

Before submitting your module for technical validation, make sure you have used the [Validator](https://validator.prestashop.com/).

It runs several checks to make sure your module will run smoothly on PrestaShop. As it is not currently open source, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ti40qkdW0kKhSWTJX6lwH-485alLd21YX9VZnq-roZ8/edit?usp=sharing) to learn about the different checks it performs.

### Look At the Validation Checklist

Make sure your module is compliant with all the rules listed in the [validation checklist](../10-validation-checklist/README.md).

### Add Your Module Key

After submitting your marketing information, follow this procedure to add your `module_key` to your module:

1. Log in to your [PrestaShop Marketplace account](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/login).

2. Access your seller account.

3. In the **Products** section, select the module you are working on.

4. Scroll down, and click on **Click here to add a zip**:

    ![Upload link](/assets/images/submission/submission-upload-link.png)

5. Copy your module key:

    ![Module key](/assets/images/submission/submission-module-key.png)

6. Access the `<module_name>.php` file at the root of your module folder, and add the module key to the `construct` function as follows:

    ```php
    <?php
    public function __construct() {
      // etc.
      $this->module_key = 'c1614c239af92968e5fae97f366e9961';
    }
    ```

7. Save your file.

:arrow_right: Your module key is now added to your module.

:::warning PS Billings Live Mode
If you are using the PS Billings component, it is necessary to activate the Live mode by changing the Sandbox argument to false, like in the code below.
:::

```yaml
ps_billings.context_wrapper:
    class: 'PrestaShopCorp\Billing\Wrappers\BillingContextWrapper'
    arguments:
    - '@ps_accounts.facade'
    - '@<module_name>.context'
    - false # if true, enables the sandbox mode, if false or empty, disables it
```

### Upload Your Module

Now that you have added the key, you can upload the module to your seller account. Proceed as follows:

1. Zip your module. 

  :::tip Note
  The zip archive submitted to our team must contain all the necessary files for your module, and have the same name as your module: if the main file of your module is called "module_name.php", then it should be in the "module_name" folder, in the "module_name.zip" archive â€“ without a version number, and without adding "PrestaShop" or "module".

  Make sure that the name used for your file and zip is also the same as the one you used for your product page (so that the online seller can quickly identify your module in the back office of their store). Feel free to customize the name, for example with the name of your company or your initials.
  :::

2. Go back to the submission page on your seller account.

3. Specify the PrestaShop versions your module supports and add a least one changelog.

3. Upload your zip. You might encounter the following issues:

    > Issue 1: Do not zip your module on a Mac computer, or if you do, use a Mac cleaner such as [ZipCleaner](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25497/zipcleaner) to remove the additional files.

    > Issue 2: Your folder structure might be invalid. If so, try to compress the module folder instead of the files.

    > Issue 3: Your module size might be too big. Check the assets and see if you can remove images.

    > Issue 4: The file name migh be incorrect. Your zip name must match the folder module name.

    > Issue 5: `$this->name` can only contain alphanumeric characters (lowercase) & underscores. Make sure your module name is *abcde_fgh*. Do not use any constant.

4. Reupload your file until every issue is fixed.

5. Check the required boxes, and click on **Submit your file**.

:arrow_right: When you submit your zip, it will be automatically sent to the validator, then the technical team will test it and review the code.  It usually takes us **5 to 10 working days** to review the contents. Once your module has been verified, you will receive an e-mail informing you of its status (:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;approved or :x:&nbsp;rejected). If there is any issue, you will get **detailed information on what to change** before resubmitting your module.

:arrow_right: After technical validation, the marketing team will check the product page information provided in all selected languages within 10 working days. You will also be notified by e-mail of the validation status and of necessary changes, if any. Finally, your module will be made available to merchants on the PrestaShop Marketplace.
