# Overview

This section will rapidly bring you up to speed as to how you can integrate Prestashop Billing into your module.

## Getting Started

1. Integrate your module with [PrestaShop Account](../../4-prestashop-account/README.md).
2. Check if your pricing model is compatible with [what we support](../2-concepts/README.md#pricing-models) or ask us directly if in doubt, we'll be happy to help.  
3. Familiarize yourself with our [key concepts](../2-concepts/README.md).
4. Follow [our tutorial](#tutorial) for a step-by-step guide.
5. Optionally take a look at how our [How-tos](../4-how-tos/README.md) that explore some advanced topics.

## Documentation

This documentation is organized as follow:

- [Concepts](../2-concepts/README.md) that help you understand how Prestashop Billing works.
- [A main tutorial](../3-tutorial/README.md) that guides you through the implementation of Prestashop Billing with a basic example module.
- [Several "How-tos"](../4-how-tos/README.md) containing extra tutorials for advanced topics (like [displaying an Invoice Pane](#display-the-invoice-pane), or [implementing a Stair-Step pricing model](#implementing-a-stair-step-pricing-model))
- [Our API](../5-references/README.md)'s reference.
